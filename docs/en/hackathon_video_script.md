This emotional roller coaster—from almost losing everything to life-changing gains—has me literally shaking. The relief is incredible, but I can't let euphoria drive my next moves. Key takeaways: 1) Never risk money I can't afford to lose, 2) Diversification is everything, 3) Maybe take profits on half my position, 4) Time to come clean with my wife about all of this.

This whole experience proved AI's game-changing potential while teaching me some tough lessons about risk. Tonight, I can finally sleep peacefully for the first time in months."
